Imperialist-Bastards

Prototype of a turn-based strategy game based on the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath. As one of the major nations, colonize or exploit less developed nations, develop rail-lines and factories, trade goods on the World Market, build a great army and navy, and develop a thriving middle clas.

The back-end is fairly mature at this point. The GUI is currently under development on the GUI branch.
